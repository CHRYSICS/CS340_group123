Group Project for Job Board Database

To setup (and not need to download 'node_modules'):
1. copy all files except node_modules to local project directory
2. Install Nodejs & npm if not already down
3. In project directory, enter in terminal: 'npm install'
This will install all dependencies needed via package.json

To run:
node server.js {port number}

Note: './config/dbcon.js' contains example log-in information for connecting to database. Change info to connect to different database.

Note: './config/schema.js' contains the schema for the project. Upload this to database to initalize 
tables first. This has already been down for the example database provided.
